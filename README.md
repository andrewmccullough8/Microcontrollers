# Microcontrollers
Code and schematics for embedded programming and microcontroller design.

The Atmega128 and Atmega 48 boards were used to create a clock radio with temperature readings and display dimming. 

A seven segement display was used for the display which can show the time, alarm setting, and tuning frequency. Pushbuttons were used to switch between display modes. Two encoders were used to change time, alarm setting, volume, and frequency. RS-232 communication was used between the Atmega128 and the Atmega28.
